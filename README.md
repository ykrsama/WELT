# WELT (Workflow Enhanced LLM with CoT)

For specific task, specific but optimized workflow generally performs better than a generalized workflow.

Can we train some example workflows into a single model and:
- Let model to decide whicih specific workflow to use
- Emerge it's own workflow during RL
